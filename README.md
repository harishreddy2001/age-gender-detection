# age-gender-detection
The Age &amp; Gender Detection project uses deep learning to identify a personâ€™s age range and gender from their face. It first detects the face using OpenCV, then predicts age and gender using a CNN model trained on labeled images. This technology is useful in security, marketing, and AI applications. ðŸš€
